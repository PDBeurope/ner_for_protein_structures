564	583	dimetal active site	site	These observations strongly suggest that an acidic residue is not directly involved in catalysis by PduL. Instead, the dimetal active site of PduL may create a nucleophile from one of the hydroxyl groups on free phosphate to attack the carbonyl carbon of the thioester bond of an acyl-CoA. In the reverse direction, the metal ion(s) could stabilize the thiolate anion that would attack the carbonyl carbon of an acyl-phosphate; a similar mechanism has been described for phosphatases where hydroxyl groups or hydroxide ions can act as a base when coordinated by a dimetal active site.
