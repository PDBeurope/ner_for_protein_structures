Besides kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors, PPTI shows clear-cut similarities with dendrotoxins (DTXs), the other kunitz-type protein subfamily. The most important reason is the presence of functionally important residues of DTXs at correspondingly the same positions in PPTI. As such, we proposed the new ability of PPTI for inhibiting voltage-gated potassium channels and consequently its dual functionality. At first, we determined the solution structure of PPTI via Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Then by homology modeling, we constructed the model structure of trypsin-PPTI complex to confirm the same interaction pattern as trypsin-BPTI at complex interface. Finally, by Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations of PPTI NMR derived ensemble structure as ligand against homology model of human Kv1.1 potassium channel as receptor, we evaluated the potential DTX-like activity of PPTI. The results of our study support the proposed dual functionality of PPTI.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1316</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1329</offset><text>Kunitz-type proteins are one of the most-studied protein families due to their diverse physiological functions and stable conformation. Members of this protein family are small globular proteins (about 60 amino acid residues in length) with native compact conformation and distinct arrangement of secondary structure motifs, known as kunitz domain. Their overall conformation is stabilized via three intra-chain disulfide bonds with highly conserved pattern of C1-C6, C2-C4, and C3-C5. This compact and stable structure of kunitz domain could be the reason for its wide usage in proteins with extracellular destination, in both mono and multi-domain forms, during evolution.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2004</offset><text>Diverging evolution of kunitz-type proteins has been leading to the formation of homologous proteins with different physiological functions including kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors and dendrotoxins (DTXs). The overall tertiary structures of these homologues are almost the same, while their functional sites and amino acid compositions are dramatically changed. As such, in kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors functionally important residues (residues of anti-protease loop) are located in completely different part of the molecules, in comparison with DTXs. Interestingly, there are only a few reported proteins with both functions of inhibiting serine proteases and blocking potassium channels. The common characteristic of these proteins is to show one of their physiological functions weaker than the other one, and more importantly, almost all of them are effective potassium channel blockers which could weakly interfere with proteolytic activity of serine proteases.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2989</offset><text>The kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors could reversibly inhibit serine proteases via a slow-tight interaction pattern. In Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (BPTI), the well-studied member of kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors, the interacting residues are located within two exposed loops consisting residues T11 to I19 (the anti-protease loop) and G36 to R39. In trypsin-BPTI complex the critical P1 residue of BPTI, K15, located at the anti-protease loop, interacts with D191 and S197 in S1 pocket of trypsin.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3503</offset><text>On the other hand, DTXs act as a facilitator of neurotransmitter release from pre-synaptic neurons by blocking ionic current in voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv). For an effective interaction with Kv channels, a basic residue of DTXs interacts with both negatively charged (E353 and D431 in Kv1.1) and aromatic residues (Y379 in Kv1.1) of the pore region in Kv channels. According to site-directed mutagenesis studies, this basic residue along with a hydrophobic residue are mostly responsible in making interactions with Kv channels, and simultaneous mutations of these two residues cause a great reduction (about 1000 times) in DTXs function against Kv channels. In addition, the configuration of functional sites in DTX variants is in a way that the critical basic residue protrudes from the functional surface and keeps a certain distance (about 6.6±1 Å) from the hydrophobic residue.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4398</offset><text>In our previous work, we introduced PPTI (Pseudocerastes Persicus Trypsin Inhibitor) as a new member of kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors. According to the sequence comparison outcomes, the functionally important residues of DTXs are correspondingly present in PPTI, which brings up the hypothesis of PPTI bi-functionality. To evaluate this hypothesis, we used in silico approach and performed a series of Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations between PPTI NMR structures and Kv1.1 modeled structure. The results are promising and demonstrate the possible blocking activity of PPTI against potassium channels, with the same mechanism as DTXs. In what follows, we report the results of structure determination of PPTI by solution NMR spectroscopy and protein docking between PPTI NMR structures and both trypsin and Kv1.1 potassium channel by homology modeling and BD simulation, respectively.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>5293</offset><text>Results</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>5301</offset><text>NMR resonance assignment</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5326</offset><text>According to the standard methods, manual amino acid spin systems identification and sequential assignment were performed based on homonuclear TOCSY and NOESY spectra.

The observed long range NOEs between Hα-HN and Hα-Hα of residues confirm the existence of hydrogen bond pattern of a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, S2 Fig. To solve the ambiguities associated with the NOE assignment of NOESY spectrum or spin system identification due to the shielding or desheilding effect of aromatic rings, we used the constructed homology model of PPTI as the guiding structure.

As such, the side chain of a critical lysine in DTX makes electrostatic and π-cationic interactions with negatively charged and hydrophobic residues in the pore region of potassium channel respectively. In Kv channel variants, the critical residues that interact with inhibitors (like DTXs) are mostly located in the loop connecting S5 and S6, named as P-loop in literature. There is a highly conserved motif sequence in P-loop (TXGYGD, known as the signature sequence of Kv channels) which seems to be mainly responsible for making interaction with DTX homologues. Thus for BD docking simulation, we selected nitrogen atom of ε-amine group of K5 residue from PPTI and oxygen atom of a water molecule which was placed at the pore entry of Kv1.1 with equal distances from four aspartic acid residues of the channel pore region, as the monitor atoms for detecting the formation of association. At the beginning in order to do a blind docking, we used the large distance criteria (15 to 30 Å) to find the better understanding of all possible docking orientations of PPTI relative to Kv1.1 in BD simulations. Interestingly and as we expected for the large monitor distances of association, the spatial distribution of center of mass of PPTI was mainly populated over the pore region of channel, S4 Fig. Then to have a better resolution, we set the monitor distance of association in decreasing manner from 10 to 5 Å in different simulations. In order to improve the rigid docking performance, a hundred uniformly sampled snapshot structures of PPTI from NPT MD trajectory (with 2.5 ns interval time) along with proposed structure for human Kv1.1 potassium channel were used as the initial structures for BD simulations. The interaction mode of the best energetic complex between PPTI and Kv1.1 potassium channel is shown in Fig 6A (side view) and Fig 6B (top view). As Fig 6A shows, the ε-amine group of K5 is in close contact with the water molecule at the pore region. In order to analyze the diversity of interaction modes, the fifty best energetic complexes are superimposed on each other (top view is shown in Fig 6C) and the RMSD of each PPTI structure was calculated with respect to the best energetic one and as Fig 6C shows, the overall interaction orientation of these fifty complexes are the same. The average value of RMSD was about 5.0 Å with minimum and maximum values of 1.3 and 8.4 Å, respectively.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">pone.0214657.g006.jpg</infon><infon key="id">pone.0214657.g006</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>17446</offset><text>The modeled complex of PPTI and human Kv1.1 potassium channel.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">pone.0214657.g006.jpg</infon><infon key="id">pone.0214657.g006</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>17509</offset><text>(A) The side view of the complex.

The best solved structures derived from solution NMR spectroscopy confirmed the presence of the motif structure known as kunitz domain in PPTI. Like kunitz-type proteins, the domain structure of PPTI is stabilized with the same topology of three highly-conserved intra-chain disulfide bonds. As a result, the both helical parts are brought in close contact with each other via the C7-C57 disulfide bond, and the α-helix in C-terminal part is located over the β-sheet motif via the C32-C50 disulfide bond.

The anti-trypsin activity of PPTI was experimentally determined and the constructed model structure of trypsin-PPTI complex revealed the details of this interaction. Like BPTI, the P1 residue of PPTI (K17) contributes critically in interactions with the key residues of trypsin S1 pocket (i.e. H57, D191, and S197). Next, for evaluating the ability of PPTI in blocking potassium channels we performed a series of BD simulations between PPTI and human Kv1.1 potassium channel, and compared the mechanism of interaction with α-DTX, a well-known dendrotoxin. The results of this part show that PPTI could block Kv1.1 potassium channels with the same mechanism as dendrotoxins. Therefore, we can speculate the possibility of dendrotoxin-like activity of PPTI against Kv1.1 potassium channels, which makes PPTI as a possible bi-functional protein. Interestingly, almost all of the reported bi-functional kunitz-type proteins between serine protease inhibitors and dendrotoxins are effective potassium channel blockers with weak anti-protease activities in which PPTI is different. Although the results of our in silico evaluation are promising, further experimental evaluations about PPTI’s dendrotoxin-like activity are needed in order to prove its dual-functionality.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>21511</offset><text>Materials and methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>21533</offset><text>Molecular modeling of the 3D structure of PPTI</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21580</offset><text>In order to overcome the ambiguity in identifying NMR derived restraints, the 3D structure of PPTI was modeled by comparative homology modeling according to our previous work.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>21756</offset><text>Sample preparation for NMR spectroscopy</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21796</offset><text>PPTI was purified from the venom of Persian false-horned viper, Pseudocerastes persicus, according to the procedure described previously and lyophilized by freeze dryer.

We used this package for assigning the titratable groups, solving the linearized Possion-Boltzmann (PB) equation and running BD simulation. In order to compensate the rigidity of PPTI, we did a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to sample enough solution conformations. The MD simulations were carried out with the GROMACS simulation package version 4.6.5 using the Amber99SB-ILDN force field parameters as implemented in GROMACS. After energy minimization, two succeeding position-restrained MD simulations were performed. First, to set the atomic velocities and adjust the system temperature, an MD simulation was performed for 100 ps at desired temperature and in a constant volume condition (NVT). Second, to adjust pressure and densities, a MD simulation with 1 ns duration was carried out at constant temperature and pressure (NPT). Then, a 250 ns NPT simulation was performed to produce an ensemble of PPTI conformations uniformly sampled every 2.5 ns. The coordinates of PPTI structures from the NPT MD trajectory along with Kv1.1 channel structure from homology modeling were used as the initial structures in BD simulations. The atomic charges of titratable functional groups of amino acid side chains were assigned according to Tanford-Kirkwood method as implemented in MacroDox according to the solvent ionic strength of 0.1 M, temperature of 298 K and pH value of 7.0. The PB equation was solved for two cubic lattices, and the center of mass of Kv1.1 channel as receptor was placed at the center of lattice. The resolutions were set to 0.5 and 0.75 Å for inner and outer grids respectively. At the beginning of each trajectory, the center of mass of PPTI was randomly placed on surface of a sphere with radius of 82 Å that its center is located in the center of simulation lattice. Only PPTI was allowed to rotate and translate and Kv1.1 channel was immobilized in the center of simulation lattice. Whenever the distance between the center of mass of PPTI and Kv1.1 channel exceeded an escape radius of 200 Å, the trial trajectory was terminated. In order to reach a suitable complex model between PPTI and Kv1.1 potassium channel we did 100,000 trial trajectories in each BD simulation.</text></passage><passage><infon
