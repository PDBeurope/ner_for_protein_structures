Trypsin Inhibitor), a kunitz-type protein with inhibitory effect against trypsin proteolytic activity. Besides kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors, PPTI shows clear-cut similarities with dendrotoxins (DTXs), the other kunitz-type protein subfamily. The most important reason is the presence of functionally important residues of DTXs at correspondingly the same positions in PPTI. As such, we proposed the new ability of PPTI for inhibiting voltage-gated potassium channels and consequently its dual functionality. At first, we determined the solution structure of PPTI via Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Then by homology modeling, we constructed the model structure of trypsin-PPTI complex to confirm the same interaction pattern as trypsin-BPTI at complex interface. Finally, by Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations of PPTI NMR derived ensemble structure as ligand against homology model of human Kv1.1 potassium channel as receptor, we evaluated the potential DTX-like activity of PPTI. The results of our study support the proposed dual functionality of PPTI.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>University of Tehran</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8319-1030</contrib-id><name><surname>Amininasab</surname><given-names>Mehriar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was financially supported by the Research Council of the University of Tehran.

Members of this protein family are small globular proteins (about 60 amino acid residues in length) with native compact conformation and distinct arrangement of secondary structure motifs, known as kunitz domain [<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Their overall conformation is stabilized via three intra-chain disulfide bonds with highly conserved pattern of C1-C6, C2-C4, and C3-C5 [<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This compact and stable structure of kunitz domain could be the reason for its wide usage in proteins with extracellular destination [<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], in both mono and multi-domain forms, during evolution [<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Diverging evolution of kunitz-type proteins has been leading to the formation of homologous proteins with different physiological functions including kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors and dendrotoxins (DTXs) [<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The overall tertiary structures of these homologues are almost the same, while their functional sites and amino acid compositions are dramatically changed [<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As such, in kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors functionally important residues (residues of anti-protease loop) are located in completely different part of the molecules, in comparison with DTXs [<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Interestingly, there are only a few reported proteins with both functions of inhibiting serine proteases and blocking potassium channels. The common characteristic of these proteins is to show one of their physiological functions weaker than the other one, and more importantly, almost all of them are effective potassium channel blockers which could weakly interfere with proteolytic activity of serine proteases [<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors could reversibly inhibit serine proteases via a slow-tight interaction pattern [<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (BPTI), the well-studied member of kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors, the interacting residues are located within two exposed loops consisting residues T11 to I19 (the anti-protease loop) and G36 to R39. In trypsin-BPTI complex the critical P1 residue of BPTI, K15, located at the anti-protease loop, interacts with D191 and S197 in S1 pocket of trypsin [<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, DTXs act as a facilitator of neurotransmitter release from pre-synaptic neurons by blocking ionic current in voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv) [<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For an effective interaction with Kv channels, a basic residue of DTXs interacts with both negatively charged (E353 and D431 in Kv1.1) and aromatic residues (Y379 in Kv1.1) of the pore region in Kv channels [<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. According to site-directed mutagenesis studies, this basic residue along with a hydrophobic residue are mostly responsible in making interactions with Kv channels, and simultaneous mutations of these two residues cause a great reduction (about 1000 times) in DTXs function against Kv channels [<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, the configuration of functional sites in DTX variants is in a way that the critical basic residue protrudes from the functional surface [<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and keeps a certain distance (about 6.6&#x000b1;1 &#x000c5;) from the hydrophobic residue [<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>In our previous work [<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], we introduced PPTI (<italic>Pseudocerastes Persicus</italic> Trypsin Inhibitor) as a new member of kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors. According to the sequence comparison outcomes, the functionally important residues of DTXs are correspondingly present in PPTI, which brings up the hypothesis of PPTI bi-functionality. To evaluate this hypothesis, we used in silico approach and performed a series of Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations between PPTI NMR structures and Kv1.1 modeled structure. The results are promising and demonstrate the possible blocking activity of PPTI against potassium channels, with the same mechanism as DTXs. In what follows, we report the results of structure determination of PPTI by solution NMR spectroscopy and protein docking between PPTI NMR structures and both trypsin and Kv1.1 potassium channel by homology modeling and BD simulation, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>NMR resonance assignment</title><p>According to the standard methods, manual amino acid spin systems identification and sequential assignment were performed based on homonuclear TOCSY and NOESY spectra.

In Kv channel variants, the critical residues that interact with inhibitors (like DTXs) are mostly located in the loop connecting S5 and S6, named as P-loop in literature.

The best solved structures derived from solution NMR spectroscopy confirmed the presence of the motif structure known as kunitz domain in PPTI. Like kunitz-type proteins, the domain structure of PPTI is stabilized with the same topology of three highly-conserved intra-chain disulfide bonds. As a result, the both helical parts are brought in close contact with each other via the C7-C57 disulfide bond, and the &#x003b1;-helix in C-terminal part is located over the &#x003b2;-sheet motif via the C32-C50 disulfide bond. Also, PPTI has a flexible C-terminal tail, residues S60 to P68, which is not a common structural feature among small kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors and DTX variants.</p><p>Based on the calculated RASA indexes for the amino acids of PPTI, K5 and K17 are among the highly solution exposed residues that are proposed to be responsible for blocking potassium channels and inhibiting trypsin, respectively. The anti-trypsin activity of PPTI was experimentally determined [<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and the constructed model structure of trypsin-PPTI complex revealed the details of this interaction. Like BPTI, the P1 residue of PPTI (K17) contributes critically in interactions with the key residues of trypsin S1 pocket (i.e. H57, D191, and S197). Next, for evaluating the ability of PPTI in blocking potassium channels we performed a series of BD simulations between PPTI and human Kv1.1 potassium channel, and compared the mechanism of interaction with &#x003b1;-DTX, a well-known dendrotoxin. The results of this part show that PPTI could block Kv1.1 potassium channels with the same mechanism as dendrotoxins. Therefore, we can speculate the possibility of dendrotoxin-like activity of PPTI against Kv1.1 potassium channels, which makes PPTI as a possible bi-functional protein. Interestingly, almost all of the reported bi-functional kunitz-type proteins between serine protease inhibitors and dendrotoxins are effective potassium channel blockers with weak anti-protease activities in which PPTI is different [<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0214657.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].
