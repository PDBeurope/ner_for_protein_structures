The N-terminal propeptides protecting the active-site threonines are autocatalytically released only on completion of assembly. However, the trigger for the self-activation and the reason for the strict conservation of threonine as the active site nucleophile remain enigmatic. Here we use mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography and biochemical assays to suggest that Lys33 initiates nucleophilic attack of the propeptide by deprotonating the Thr1 hydroxyl group and that both residues together with Asp17 are part of a catalytic triad. Substitution of Thr1 by Cys disrupts the interaction with Lys33 and inactivates the proteasome. Although a Thr1Ser mutant is active, it is less efficient compared with wild type because of the unfavourable orientation of Ser1 towards incoming substrates. This work provides insights into the basic mechanism of proteolysis and propeptide autolysis, as well as the evolutionary pressures that drove the proteasome to become a threonine protease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

Its seven different &#x003b1; and seven different &#x003b2; subunits assemble into four heptameric rings that are stacked on each other to form a hollow cylinder. While the inactive &#x003b1; subunits build the two outer rings, the &#x003b2; subunits form the inner rings. Only three out of the seven different &#x003b2; subunits, namely &#x003b2;1, &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;5, bear N-terminal proteolytic active centres, and before CP maturation these are protected by propeptides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. In the last stage of CP biogenesis, the prosegments are autocatalytically removed through nucleophilic attack by the active site residue Thr1 on the preceding peptide bond involving Gly(-1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Release of the propeptides creates a functionally active CP that cleaves proteins into short peptides.</p><p>Although the chemical nature of the substrate-binding channel and hence substrate preferences are unique to each of the distinct active &#x003b2; subunits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, all active sites employ an identical reaction mechanism to hydrolyse peptide bonds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Nucleophilic attack of Thr1O<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> on the carbonyl carbon atom of the scissile peptide bond creates a first cleavage product and a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate. Hydrolysis of this complex by the addition of a nucleophilic water molecule regenerates the enzyme and releases the second peptide fragment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The proteasome belongs to the family of N-terminal nucleophilic (Ntn) hydrolases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, and the free N-terminal amine group of Thr1 was proposed to deprotonate the Thr1 hydroxyl group to generate a nucleophilic Thr1O<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> for peptide-bond cleavage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. This mechanism, however, cannot explain autocatalytic precursor processing because in the immature active sites, Thr1N is part of the peptide bond with Gly(-1), the bond that needs to be hydrolysed. An alternative candidate for deprotonating the Thr1 hydroxyl group is the side chain of Lys33 as it is within hydrogen-bonding distance to Thr1OH (2.7&#x02009;&#x000c5;). In principle it could function as the general base during both autocatalytic removal of the propeptide and protein substrate cleavage. Here we provide experimental evidences for this distinct view of the proteasome active-site mechanism. Data from biochemical and structural analyses of proteasome variants with mutations in the &#x003b2;5 propeptide and the active site strongly support the model and deliver novel insights into the structural constraints required for the autocatalytic activation of the proteasome. Furthermore, we determine the advantages of Thr over Cys or Ser as the active-site nucleophile using X-ray crystallography together with activity and inhibition assays.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Inactivation of proteasome subunits by T1A mutations</title><p>Proteasome-mediated degradation of cell-cycle regulators and potentially toxic misfolded proteins is required for the viability of eukaryotic cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.

Yeast strains carrying the single mutations &#x003b2;1-T1A or &#x003b2;2-T1A, or both, are viable, even though one or two of the three distinct catalytic &#x003b2; subunits are disabled and carry remnants of their N-terminal propeptides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). These results indicate that the &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2 proteolytic activities are not essential for cell survival. By contrast, the T1A mutation in subunit &#x003b2;5 has been reported to be lethal or nearly so<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Viability is restored if the &#x003b2;5-T1A subunit has its propeptide (pp) deleted but expressed separately <italic>in trans</italic> (&#x003b2;5-T1A pp <italic>trans</italic>), although substantial phenotypic impairment remains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Our present crystallographic analysis of the &#x003b2;5-T1A pp <italic>trans</italic> mutant demonstrates that the mutation <italic>per se</italic> does not structurally alter the catalytic active site and that the <italic>trans</italic>-expressed &#x003b2;5 propeptide is not bound in the &#x003b2;5 substrate-binding channel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><p>The extremely weak growth of the &#x003b2;5-T1A mutant pp <italic>cis</italic> described by Chen and Hochstrasser<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> compared with the inviability reported by Heinemeyer <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> prompted us to analyse this discrepancy. Sequencing of the plasmids, testing them in both published yeast strain backgrounds and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the &#x003b2;5-T1A mutant pp <italic>cis</italic> is viable, but suffers from a marked growth defect that requires extended incubation of 4&#x02013;5 days for initial colony formation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and Supplementary Methods). We also identified an additional point mutation K81R in subunit &#x003b2;5 that was present in the allele used in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. This single amino-acid exchange is located at the interface of the subunits &#x003b1;4, &#x003b2;4 and &#x003b2;5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>) and might weakly promote CP assembly by enhancing inter-subunit contacts. The slightly better growth of the &#x003b2;5-T1A-K81R mutant allowed us to solve the crystal structure of a yeast proteasome (yCP) with the &#x003b2;5-T1A mutation, which is discussed in the following section (for details see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Propeptide conformation and triggering of autolysis</title><p>In the final steps of proteasome biogenesis, the propeptides are autocatalytically cleaved from the mature &#x003b2;-subunit domains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. For subunit &#x003b2;1, this process was previously inferred to require that the propeptide residue at position (-2) of the subunit precursor occupies the S1 specificity pocket of the substrate-binding channel formed by amino acid 45 (for details see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 2</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Furthermore, it was observed that the prosegment forms an antiparallel &#x003b2;-sheet in the active site, and that Gly(-1) adopts a &#x003b3;-turn conformation, which by definition is characterized by a hydrogen bond between Leu(-2)O and Thr1NH (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Here we again analysed the &#x003b2;1-T1A mutant crystallographically but in addition determined the structures of the &#x003b2;2-T1A single and &#x003b2;1-T1A-&#x003b2;2-T1A double mutants (Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry codes are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In subunit &#x003b2;1, we found that Gly(-1) indeed forms a sharp turn, which relaxes on prosegment cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). However, the &#x003b3;-turn conformation and the associated hydrogen bond initially proposed is for geometric and chemical reasons inappropriate and would not perfectly position the carbonyl carbon atom of Gly(-1) for nucleophilic attack by Thr1. Regarding the &#x003b2;2 propeptide, Thr(-2) occupies the S1 pocket but is less deeply anchored compared with Leu(-2) in &#x003b2;1, which might be due to the rather large &#x003b2;2-S1 pocket created by Gly45. Thr(-2) positions Gly(-1)O via hydrogen bonding (&#x0223c;2.8&#x02009;&#x000c5;) in a perfect trajectory for the nucleophilic attack by Thr1O<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). Next, we examined the position of the &#x003b2;5 propeptide in the &#x003b2;5-T1A-K81R mutant. Surprisingly, Gly(-1) is completely extended and forces the histidine side chain at position (-2) to occupy the S2 instead of the S1 pocket, thereby disrupting the antiparallel &#x003b2;-sheet. Nonetheless, the carbonyl carbon of Gly(-1) would be ideally placed for nucleophilic attack by Thr1O<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c,d</xref>). As the K81R mutation is located far from the active site (Thr1C<sup>&#x003b1;</sup>&#x02013;Arg81C<sup>&#x003b1;</sup>: 24&#x02009;&#x000c5;), any influence on propeptide conformation can be excluded. Instead, the plasticity of the &#x003b2;5 S1 pocket caused by the rotational flexibility of Met45 might prevent stable accommodation of His(-2) in the S1 site and thus also promote its immediate release after autolysis.</p><p>Processing of &#x003b2;-subunit precursors requires deprotonation of Thr1OH; however, the general base initiating autolysis is unknown. Remarkably, eukaryotic proteasomal &#x003b2;5 subunits bear a His residue in position (-2) of the propeptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). As histidine commonly functions as a proton shuttle in the catalytic triads of serine proteases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, we investigated the role of His(-2) in processing of the &#x003b2;5 propeptide by exchanging it for Asn, Lys, Phe and Ala. All yeast mutants were viable at 30&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, but suffered from growth defects at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C with the H(-2)N and H(-2)F mutants being most affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). In agreement, the chymotrypsin-like (ChT-L) activity of H(-2)N and H(-2)F mutant yCPs was impaired <italic>in situ</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). Structural analyses revealed that the propeptides of all mutant yCPs shared residual 2<italic>F</italic><sub>O</sub>&#x02013;<italic>F</italic><sub>C</sub> electron densities. Gly(-1) and Phe/Lys(-2) were visualized at low occupancy, while Ala/Asn(-2) could not be assigned. This observation indicates a mixture of processed and unprocessed &#x003b2;5 subunits and partially impaired autolysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, thereby excluding any essential role of residue (-2) as the general base.</p><p>Next, we examined the effect of residue (-2) on the orientation of the propeptide by creating mutants that combine the T1A (K81R) mutation(s) with H(-2)L, H(-2)T or H(-2)A substitutions. Leu(-2) is encoded in the yeast &#x003b2;1 subunit precursor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>); Thr(-2) is generally part of &#x003b2;2-propeptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>); and Ala(-2) was expected to fit the &#x003b2;5-S1 pocket without inducing conformational changes of Met45, allowing it to accommodate &#x02018;&#x003b2;1-like' propeptide positioning. As expected from &#x003b2;5-T1A mutants, the yeasts show severe growth phenotypes, with minor variations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). We determined crystal structures of the &#x003b2;5-H(-2)L-T1A, &#x003b2;5-H(-2)T-T1A and the &#x003b2;5-H(-2)A-T1A-K81R mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). For the &#x003b2;5-H(-2)A-T1A-K81R variant, only the residues Gly(-1) and Ala(-2) could be visualized, indicating that Ala(-2) leads to insufficient stabilization of the propeptide in the substrate-binding channel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4d</xref>). By contrast, the prosegments of the &#x003b2;5-H(-2)L-T1A and the &#x003b2;5-H(-2)T-T1A mutants were significantly better resolved in the 2<italic>F</italic><sub>O</sub>&#x02013;<italic>F</italic><sub>C</sub> electron-density maps yet not at full occupancy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), suggesting that the natural propeptide bearing His(-2) is most favourable. Nevertheless, both Leu(-2) and Thr(-2) were found to occupy the S1 specificity pocket formed by Met45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4f&#x02013;h</xref>). This result proves that the naturally occurring His(-2) of the &#x003b2;5 propeptide does not stably fit into the S1 site. Since Gly(-1) adopts the same position in both wild-type (WT) and mutant &#x003b2;5 propeptides, and since in all cases its carbonyl carbon is perfectly placed for nucleophilic attack by Thr1O<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>), we propose that neither binding of residue (-2) to the S1 pocket nor formation of the antiparallel &#x003b2;-sheet is essential for autolysis of the propeptide.</p><p>Next, we determined the crystal structure of a chimeric yCP having the yeast &#x003b2;1-propeptide replaced by its &#x003b2;5 counterpart<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Although we observed fragments of 2<italic>F</italic><sub>O</sub>&#x02013;<italic>F</italic><sub>C</sub> electron density in the &#x003b2;1 active site, the data were not interpretable. Bearing in mind that in contrast to Thr(-2) in &#x003b2;2, Leu(-2) in subunit &#x003b2;1 is not conserved among species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>), we created a &#x003b2;2-T(-2)V proteasome mutant. As proven by the &#x003b2;2-T1A crystal structures, Thr(-2) hydrogen bonds to Gly(-1)O. Although this interaction was not observed for the &#x003b2;5-H(-2)T-T1A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4c,i</xref>), exchange of Thr(-2) by Val in &#x003b2;2, a conservative mutation regarding size but drastic with respect to polarity, was found to inhibit maturation of this subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4e,j</xref>). Notably, the 2<italic>F</italic><sub>O</sub>&#x02013;<italic>F</italic><sub>C</sub> electron-density map displays a different orientation for the &#x003b2;2 propeptide than has been observed for the &#x003b2;2-T1A proteasome. In particular, Val(-2) is displaced from the S1 site and Gly(-1) is severely shifted (movement of the carbonyl oxygen atom of 3.8&#x02009;&#x000c5;), thereby preventing nucleophilic attack of Thr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4j,k</xref>). These results further confirm that correct positioning of the active-site residues and Gly(-1) is decisive for the maturation of the proteasome.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The active site of the proteasome</title><p>Proton shuttling from the proteasomal active site Thr1OH to Thr1NH<sub>2</sub> via a nucleophilic water molecule was suggested to initiate peptide-bond hydrolysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.

Twenty years later, with a plethora of yCP X-ray structures in hand, we decided to re-analyse the active site of the proteasome and to resolve the uncertainty regarding the nature of the general base. Mutation of &#x003b2;5-Lys33 to Ala causes a strongly deleterious phenotype, and previous structural and biochemical analyses confirmed that this is caused by failure of propeptide cleavage, and consequently, lack of ChT-L activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>; for details see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). The phenotype of the &#x003b2;5-K33A mutant was however less pronounced than for the &#x003b2;5-T1A-K81R yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). This discrepancy in growth was traced to an additional point mutation L(-49)S in the &#x003b2;5-propeptide of the &#x003b2;5-K33A mutant (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). Structural comparison of the &#x003b2;5-L(-49)S-K33A and &#x003b2;5-T1A-K81R active sites revealed that mutation of Lys33 to Ala creates a cavity that is filled with Thr1 and the remnant propeptide.

The Thr1 N terminus of this mutant is not blocked by the propeptide, yet its catalytic activity is reduced by &#x0223c;83&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>).

Furthermore, the crystal structure of the &#x003b2;5-K33A pp <italic>trans</italic> mutant without inhibitor revealed that Thr1O<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> strongly coordinates a well-defined water molecule (&#x0223c;2&#x02009;&#x000c5;; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c,d</xref>). This water hydrogen bonds also to Arg19O (&#x0223c;3.0&#x02009;&#x000c5;) and Asp17O<sup>&#x003b4;</sup> (&#x0223c;3.0&#x02009;&#x000c5;), and thereby presumably enables residual activity of the mutant. Remarkably, the solvent molecule occupies the position normally taken by Lys33NH<sub>2</sub> in the WT proteasome structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>), further corroborating the essential role of Lys33 as the general base for autolysis and proteolysis. Conservative substitution of Lys33 by Arg delays autolysis of the &#x003b2;5 precursor and impairs yeast growth (for details see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). While Thr1 occupies the same position as in WT yCPs, Arg33 is unable to hydrogen bond to Asp17, thereby inactivating the &#x003b2;5 active site<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>).</p><p>The conservative mutation of Asp17 to Asn in subunit &#x003b2;5 of the yCP also provokes a severe growth defect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Notably, only with the additional point mutation L(-49)S present in the &#x003b2;5 propeptide could we purify a small amount of the &#x003b2;5-D17N mutant yCP. As determined by crystallographic analysis, this mutant &#x003b2;5 subunit was partially processed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>) but displayed impaired reactivity towards the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib compared with the subunits &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2, and with WT &#x003b2;5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>).

Even though the &#x003b2;5-D17N pp <italic>trans</italic> yCP crystal structure appeared identical to the WT yCP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>), the co-crystal structure with the &#x003b1;&#x02032;, &#x003b2;&#x02032; epoxyketone inhibitor carfilzomib visualized only partial occupancy of the ligand in the &#x003b2;5 active site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). This observation is consistent with a strongly reduced reactivity of &#x003b2;5-Thr1 and the crystal structure of the &#x003b2;5-D17N pp <italic>cis</italic> mutant in complex with carfilzomib. Autolysis and residual catalytic activity of the &#x003b2;5-D17N mutants may originate from the carbonyl group of Asn17, which albeit to a lower degree still can polarize Lys33 for the activation of Thr1. In agreement, an E17A mutant in the proteasomal &#x003b2;-subunit of the archaeon <italic>Thermoplasma acidophilum</italic> prevents autolysis and catalysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Strikingly, although the X-ray data on the &#x003b2;5-D17N mutant with the propeptide expressed in <italic>cis</italic> and in <italic>trans</italic> looked similar, there was a pronounced difference in their growth phenotypes observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>).</p><p>On the basis of these results, we propose that CPs from all domains of life use a catalytic triad consisting of Thr1, Lys33 and Asp/Glu17 for both autocatalytic precursor processing and proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). This model is also consistent with the fact that no defined water molecule is observed in the mature WT proteasomal active site that could shuttle the proton from Thr1O<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> to Thr1NH<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>To explore this active-site model further, we exchanged the conserved Asp166 residue for Asn in the yeast &#x003b2;5 subunit. Asp166O<sup>&#x003b4;</sup> is hydrogen-bonded to Thr1NH<sub>2</sub> via Ser129OH and Ser169OH, and therefore was proposed to be involved in catalysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The &#x003b2;5-D166N pp <italic>cis</italic> yeast mutant is significantly impaired in growth and its ChT-L activity is drastically reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). X-ray data on the &#x003b2;5-D166N mutant indicate that the &#x003b2;5 propeptide is hydrolysed, but due to reorientation of Ser129OH, the interaction with Asn166O<sup>&#x003b4;</sup> is disrupted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>). Instead, a water molecule is bound to Ser129OH and Thr1NH<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>), which may enable precursor processing. The hydrogen bonds involving Ser169OH are intact and may account for residual substrate turnover. Soaking the &#x003b2;5-D166N crystals with carfilzomib and MG132 resulted in covalent modification of Thr1 at high occupancy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8c</xref>). In the carfilzomib complex structure, Thr1O<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> and Thr1N incorporate into a morpholine ring structure and Ser129 adopts its WT-like orientation. In the MG132-bound state, Thr1N is unmodified, and we again observe that Ser129 is hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule instead of Asn166. Whereas Asn can to some degree replace Asp166 due to its carbonyl group in the side chain, Ala at this position was found to prevent both autolysis and catalysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. These results suggest that Asp166 and Ser129 function as a proton shuttle and affect the protonation state of Thr1N during autolysis and catalysis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Substitution of the active-site Thr1 by Cys</title><p>Mutation of Thr1 to Cys inactivates the 20S proteasome from the archaeon <italic>T. acidophilum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In yeast, this mutation causes a strong growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), although the propeptide is hydrolysed, as shown here by its X-ray structure. In one of the two &#x003b2;5 subunits, however, we found the cleaved propeptide still bound in the substrate-binding channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). His(-2) occupies the S2 pocket like observed for the &#x003b2;5-T1A-K81R mutant, but in contrast to the latter, the propeptide in the T1C mutant adopts an antiparallel &#x003b2;-sheet conformation as known from inhibitors like MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c&#x02013;e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9b</xref>). On the basis of the phenotype of the T1C mutant and the propeptide remnant identified in its active site, we suppose that autolysis is retarded and may not have been completed before crystallization. Owing to the unequal positions of the two &#x003b2;5 subunits within the CP in the crystal lattice, maturation and propeptide displacement may occur at different timescales in the two subunits.</p><p>Despite propeptide hydrolysis, the &#x003b2;5-T1C active site is catalytically inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>). In agreement, soaking crystals with the CP inhibitors bortezomib or carfilzomib modifies only the &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2 active sites, while leaving the &#x003b2;5-T1C proteolytic centres unmodified even though they are only partially occupied by the cleaved propeptide remnant. Moreover, the structural data reveal that the thiol group of Cys1 is rotated by 74&#x000b0; with respect to the hydroxyl side chain of Thr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9b</xref>). This presumably results from the larger radius of the sulfur atom compared with oxygen. Consequently, the hydrogen bond bridging the active-site nucleophile and Lys33 in WT CPs is broken with Cys1. Notably, the 2<italic>F</italic><sub>O</sub>&#x02013;<italic>F</italic><sub>C</sub> electron-density map of the T1C mutant also indicates that Lys33NH<sub>2</sub> is disordered. Together, these observations suggest that efficient peptide-bond hydrolysis requires that Lys33NH<sub>2</sub> hydrogen bonds to the active site nucleophile.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The benefit of Thr over Ser as the active-site nucleophile</title><p>All proteasomes strictly employ threonine as the active-site residue instead of serine. To investigate the reason for this singularity, we analysed a &#x003b2;5-T1S mutant, which is viable but suffers from growth defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Activity assays with the &#x003b2;5-specific substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC demonstrated that the ChT-L activity of the T1S mutant is reduced by 40&#x02013;45&#x00025; compared with WT proteasomes depending on the incubation temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9c</xref>).

Crystal structure analysis of the &#x003b2;5-T1S mutant confirmed precursor processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>), and ligand-complex structures with bortezomib and carfilzomib unambiguously corroborated the reactivity of Ser1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>However, the apo crystal structure revealed that Ser1O<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> is turned away from the substrate-binding channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>). Compared with Thr1O<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> in WT CP structures, Ser1O<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> is rotated by 60&#x000b0;. This renders it unavailable for direct nucleophilic attack onto incoming substrates and first requires its reorientation, which is expected to delay substrate turnover. Because both conformations of Ser1O<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> are hydrogen-bonded to Lys33NH<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4h</xref>), the relay system is capable of hydrolysing peptide substrates, albeit at lower rates compared with Thr1. The active-site residue Thr1 is fixed in its position, as its methyl group is engaged in hydrophobic interactions with Thr3 and Ala46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4h</xref>). Consequently, the hydroxyl group of Thr1 requires no reorientation before substrate cleavage and is thus more catalytically efficient than Ser1. In agreement, at an elevated growing temperature of 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C the T1S mutant is unable to grow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, the mutant proteasome is less susceptible to proteasome inhibition by bortezomib (3.7-fold) and carfilzomib (1.8-fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). Nevertheless, inhibitor complex structures indicate identical binding modes compared with the WT yCP structures, with the same inhibitors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Notably, the affinity of the tetrapeptide carfilzomib is less impaired, as it is better stabilized in the substrate-binding channel than the dipeptide bortezomib, which lacks a defined P3 site and has only a few interactions with the surrounding protein. Hence, the mean residence time of carfilzomib at the active site is prolonged and the probability to covalently react with Ser1 is increased. Considered together, these results provide a plausible explanation for the invariance of threonine as the active-site nucleophile in proteasomes in all three domains of life, as well as in proteasome-like proteases such as HslV (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>The 20S proteasome CP is the major non-lysosomal protease in eukaryotic cells, and its assembly is highly organized.

Depending on the (-2) residue we observed various propeptide conformations, but Gly(-1) is in all structures perfectly located for the nucleophilic attack by Thr1O<sup>&#x003b3;</sup>, although it does not adopt the tight turn observed for the prosegment of subunit &#x003b2;1. From these data we conclude that only the positioning of Gly(-1) and Thr1 as well as the integrity of the proteasomal active site are required for autolysis. In this regard, inappropriate <italic>N</italic>-acetylation of the Thr1 N terminus cannot be removed by Thr1O<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> due to the rotational freedom and flexibility of the acetyl group. The propeptide needs some anchoring in the substrate-binding channel to properly position Gly(-1), but this seems to be independent of the orientation of residue (-2).</p><p>Autolytic activation of the CP constitutes one of the final steps of proteasome biogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, but the trigger for propeptide cleavage had remained enigmatic. On the basis of the numerous CP:ligand complexes solved during the past 18 years and in the current study, we provide a revised interpretation of proteasome active-site architecture. We propose a catalytic triad for the active site of the CP consisting of residues Thr1, Lys33 and Asp/Glu17, which are conserved among all proteolytically active eukaryotic, bacterial and archaeal proteasome subunits. Lys33NH<sub>2</sub> is expected to act as the proton acceptor during autocatalytic removal of the propeptides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, as well as during substrate proteolysis, while Asp17O<sup>&#x003b4;</sup> orients Lys33NH<sub>2</sub> and makes it more prone to protonation by raising its p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> (hydrogen bond distance: Lys33NH<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;Asp17O<sup>&#x003b4;</sup>: 2.9&#x02009;&#x000c5;). Analogously to the proteasome, a Thr&#x02013;Lys&#x02013;Asp triad is also found in <sc>L</sc>-asparaginase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Thus, specific protein surroundings can significantly alter the chemical properties of amino acids such as Lys to function as an acid&#x02013;base catalyst<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.</p><p>In this new view of the proteasomal active site, the positively charged Thr1NH<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-terminus hydrogen bonds to the amide nitrogen of incoming peptide substrates and stabilizes as well as activates them for the endoproteolytic cleavage by Thr1O<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Consistent with this model, the positively charged Thr1 N terminus is engaged in hydrogen bonds with inhibitory compounds like fellutamide B (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>), &#x003b1;-ketoamides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, homobelactosin C (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>) and salinosporamide A (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Furthermore, opening of the &#x003b2;-lactone compound omuralide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> by Thr1 creates a C3-hydroxyl group, whose proton originates from Thr1NH<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. The resulting uncharged Thr1NH<sub>2</sub> is hydrogen-bridged to the C3-OH group. In agreement, acetylation of the Thr1 N terminus irreversibly blocks hydrolytic activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, and binding of substrates is prevented for steric reasons. By acting as a proton donor during catalysis, the Thr1 N terminus may also favour cleavage of substrate peptide bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). In all proteases, collapse of the tetrahedral transition state results in selective breakage of the substrate amide bond, while the covalent interaction between the substrate and the enzyme persists. Cleavage of the scissile peptide bond requires protonation of the emerging free amine, and in the proteasome, the Thr1 amine group is likely to assume this function. Analogously, Thr1NH<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> might promote the bivalent reaction mode of epoxyketone inhibitors by protonating the epoxide moiety to create a positively charged trivalent oxygen atom that is subsequently nucleophilically attacked by Thr1NH<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>During autolysis the Thr1 N terminus is engaged in a hydroxyoxazolidine ring intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>), which is unstable and short-lived. Breakdown of this tetrahedral transition state releases the Thr1 N terminus that is protonated by aspartic acid 166 via Ser129OH to yield Thr1NH<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. The residues Ser129 and Asp166 are expected to increase the p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> value of Thr1N, thereby favouring its charged state. Consistent with playing an essential role in proton shuttling, the mutation D166A prevents autolysis of the archaeal CP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> and the exchange D166N impairs catalytic activity of the yeast CP about 60&#x00025;. The mutation D166N lowers the p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> of Thr1N, which is thus more likely to exist in the uncharged deprotonated state (Thr1NH<sub>2</sub>). This renders the N terminus less suitable to stabilize substrates and to protonate the first cleavage product during catalysis, although it favours its ability to act as a nucleophile. This interpretation agrees with the strongly reduced catalytic activity of the &#x003b2;5-D166N mutant on the one hand, and the ability to react readily with carfilzomib on the other. Hence, the proteasome can be viewed as having a second triad that is essential for efficient proteolysis. While Lys33NH<sub>2</sub> and Asp17O<sup>&#x003b4;</sup> are required to deprotonate the Thr1 hydroxyl side chain, Ser129OH and Asp166OH serve to protonate the N-terminal amine group of Thr1.</p><p>In accord with the proposed Thr1&#x02013;Lys33&#x02013;Asp17 catalytic triad, crystallographic data on the proteolytically inactive &#x003b2;5-T1C mutant demonstrate that the interaction of Lys33NH<sub>2</sub> and Cys1 is broken. Consequently, efficient substrate turnover or covalent modification by ligands is prevented. However, owing to Cys being a strong nucleophile, the propeptide can still be cleaved off over time. While only one single turnover is necessary for autolysis, continuous enzymatic activity is required for significant and detectable substrate hydrolysis. Notably, in the Ntn hydrolase penicillin acylase, substitution of the catalytic N-terminal Ser residue by Cys also inactivates the enzyme but still enables precursor processing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.</p><p>To investigate why the CP specifically employs threonine as its active-site residue, we used a &#x003b2;5-T1S mutant of the yCP and characterized it biochemically and structurally.

We also observed slightly lower affinity of the &#x003b2;5-T1S mutant yCP for the Food and Drug Administration-approved proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib. Structural analyses support these findings with the T1S mutant and provide an explanation for the strict use of Thr residues in proteasomes. Thr1 is well anchored in the active site by hydrophobic interactions of its C<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> methyl group with Ala46 (C<sup>&#x003b2;</sup>), Lys33 (carbon side chain) and Thr3 (C<sup>&#x003b3;</sup>). Notably, proteolytically active proteasome subunits from archaea, yeast and mammals, including constitutive, immuno- and thymoproteasome subunits, either encode Thr or Ile at position 3, indicating the importance of the C<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> for fixing the position of the nucleophilic Thr1. In contrast to Thr1, the hydroxyl group of Ser1 occupies the position of the Thr1 methyl side chain in the WT enzyme, which requires its reorientation relative to the substrate to allow cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g,h</xref>). Notably, in the threonine aspartase Taspase1, mutation of the active-site Thr234 to Ser also places the side chain in the position of the methyl group of Thr234 in the WT, thereby reducing catalytic activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.

Thr1OH is hydrogen-bonded to Lys33NH<sub>2</sub> (2.7&#x02009;&#x000c5;), which in turn interacts with Asp17O<sup>&#x003b4;</sup>. The Thr1 N terminus is engaged in hydrogen bonds with Ser129O<sup>&#x003b3;</sup>, the carbonyl oxygen of residue 168, Ser169O<sup>&#x003b3;</sup> and Asp166O<sup>&#x003b4;</sup>.

Note, the strong interaction with the water molecule causes a minor shift of Thr1, while all other active-site residues remain in place. (<bold>d</bold>) Proposed chemical reaction mechanism for autocatalytic precursor processing and proteolysis in the proteasome. The active-site Thr1 is depicted in blue, the propeptide segment and the peptide substrate are coloured in green, whereas the scissile peptide bond is highlighted in red. Autolysis (left set of structures) is initiated by deprotonation of Thr1OH via Lys33NH<sub>2</sub> and the formation of a tetrahedral transition state. The strictly conserved oxyanion hole Gly47NH stabilizing the negatively charged intermediate is illustrated as a semicircle. Collapse of the transition state frees the Thr1 N terminus (by completing an N-to-O acyl shift of the propeptide), which is subsequently protonated by Asp166OH via Ser129OH. Next, Thr1NH<sub>2</sub> polarizes a water molecule for the nucleophilic attack of the acyl-enzyme intermediate. On hydrolysis of the latter, the active-site Thr1 is ready for catalysis (right set of structures). Substrate processing starts with nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl carbon atom of the scissile peptide bond. The charged Thr1 N terminus may engage in the orientation of the amide moiety and donate a proton to the emerging N terminus of the C-terminal cleavage product. The resulting deprotonated Thr1NH<sub>2</sub> finally activates a water molecule for hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ncomms10900-f3"/></fig><fig id="f4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>The proteasome favours threonine as the active-site nucleophile.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Growth tests by serial dilution of WT and <italic>pre2</italic> (&#x003b2;5) mutant yeast cultures reveal growth defects of the active-site mutants under the indicated conditions after 2 days (2 d) of incubation.
