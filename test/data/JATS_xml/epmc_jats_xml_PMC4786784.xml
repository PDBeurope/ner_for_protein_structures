We determined four structures of an extended U2AF<sup>65</sup>&#x02013;RNA-binding domain bound to Py-tract oligonucleotides at resolutions between 2.0 and 1.5&#x02009;&#x000c5;. These structures together with RNA binding and splicing assays reveal unforeseen roles for U2AF<sup>65</sup> inter-domain residues in recognizing a contiguous, nine-nucleotide Py tract. The U2AF<sup>65</sup> linker residues between the dual RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) recognize the central nucleotide, whereas the N- and C-terminal RRM extensions recognize the 3&#x02032; terminus and third nucleotide. Single-molecule FRET experiments suggest that conformational selection and induced fit of the U2AF<sup>65</sup> RRMs are complementary mechanisms for Py-tract association. Altogether, these results advance the mechanistic understanding of molecular recognition for a major class of splice site signals.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

The splice sites are marked by relatively short consensus sequences and are regulated by additional pre-mRNA motifs (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). At the 3&#x02032; splice site of the major intron class, these include a polypyrimidine (Py) tract comprising primarily Us or Cs, which is preceded by a branch point sequence (BPS) that ultimately serves as the nucleophile in the splicing reaction and an AG-dinucleotide at the 3&#x02032; splice site junction. Disease-causing mutations often compromise pre-mRNA splicing (reviewed in refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), yet <italic>a priori</italic> predictions of splice sites and the consequences of their mutations are challenged by the brevity and degeneracy of known splice site sequences. High-resolution structures of intact splicing factor&#x02013;RNA complexes would offer key insights regarding the juxtaposition of the distinct splice site consensus sequences and their relationship to disease-causing point mutations.</p><p>The early-stage pre-mRNA splicing factor U2AF<sup>65</sup> is essential for viability in vertebrates and other model organisms (for example, ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). A tightly controlled assembly among U2AF<sup>65</sup>, the pre-mRNA, and partner proteins sequentially identifies the 3&#x02032; splice site and promotes association of the spliceosome, which ultimately accomplishes the task of splicing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.

As such, the molecular mechanisms for Py-tract recognition by the intact U2AF<sup>65</sup>&#x02013;RNA-binding domain remained unknown. Here, we use X-ray crystallography and biochemical studies to reveal new roles in Py-tract recognition for the inter-RRM linker and key residues surrounding the core U2AF<sup>65</sup> RRMs. We use single-molecule F&#x000f6;rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to characterize the conformational dynamics of this extended U2AF<sup>65</sup>&#x02013;RNA-binding domain during Py-tract recognition.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cognate U2AF<sup>65</sup>&#x02013;Py-tract recognition requires RRM extensions</title><p>The RNA affinity of the minimal U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2 domain comprising the core RRM1&#x02013;RRM2 folds (U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2, residues 148&#x02013;336) is relatively weak compared with full-length U2AF<sup>65</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Historically, this difference was attributed to the U2AF<sup>65</sup> arginine&#x02013;serine rich domain, which contacts pre-mRNA&#x02013;U2 snRNA duplexes outside of the Py tract<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.

In a fluorescence anisotropy assay for binding a representative Py tract derived from the well-characterized splice site of the adenovirus major late promoter (AdML), the RNA affinity of U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L increased by 100-fold relative to U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2 to comparable levels as full-length U2AF<sup>65</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a&#x02013;d</xref>). Likewise, both U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L and full-length U2AF<sup>65</sup> showed similar sequence specificity for U-rich stretches in the 5&#x02032;-region of the Py tract and promiscuity for C-rich regions in the 3&#x02032;-region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e&#x02013;h</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>U2AF<sup>65</sup>-bound Py tract comprises nine contiguous nucleotides</title><p>To investigate the structural basis for cognate U2AF<sup>65</sup> recognition of a contiguous Py tract, we determined four crystal structures of U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L bound to Py-tract oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). By sequential boot strapping (Methods), we optimized the oligonucleotide length, the position of a Br-dU, and the identity of the terminal nucleotide (rU, dU and rC) to achieve full views of U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L bound to contiguous Py tracts at up to 1.5&#x02009;&#x000c5; resolution. The protein and oligonucleotide conformations are nearly identical among the four new U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). The U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L RRM1 and RRM2 associate with the Py tract in a parallel, side-by-side arrangement (shown for representative structure iv in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>). An extended conformation of the U2AF<sup>65</sup> inter-RRM linker traverses across the &#x003b1;-helical surface of RRM1 and the central &#x003b2;-strands of RRM2 and is well defined in the electron density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The extensions at the N terminus of RRM1 and C terminus of RRM2 adopt well-ordered &#x003b1;-helices. Both RRM1/RRM2 extensions and the inter-RRM linker of U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L directly recognize the bound oligonucleotide. We compare the global conformation of the U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L structures with the prior dU2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2 crystal structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> and U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2 NMR structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Discussion</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>.</p><p>The discovery of nine U2AF<sup>65</sup>-binding sites for contiguous Py-tract nucleotides was unexpected.

Surprisingly, the RRM2 extension/inter-RRM linker contribute new central nucleotide-binding sites near the RRM1/RRM2 junction and the RRM1 extension recognizes the 3&#x02032;-terminal nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>). The U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L structures characterize ribose (r) nucleotides at all of the binding sites except the seventh and eighth deoxy-(d)U, which are likely to lack 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl contacts based on the RNA-bound dU2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2 structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Qualitatively, a subset of the U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L-nucleotide-binding sites (sites 1&#x02013;3 and 7&#x02013;9) share similar locations to those of the dU2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2 structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 2c,d and 3</xref>). Yet, only the U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L interactions at sites 1 and 7 are nearly identical to those of the dU2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2 structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,f</xref>). In striking departures from prior partial views, the U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L structures reveal three unanticipated nucleotide-binding sites at the centre of the Py tract, as well as numerous new interactions that underlie cognate recognition of the Py tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a&#x02013;h</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>U2AF<sup>65</sup> inter-RRM linker interacts with the Py tract</title><p>The U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L RRM2, the inter-RRM linker and RRM1 concomitantly recognize the three central nucleotides of the Py tract, which are likely to coordinate the conformational arrangement of these disparate portions of the protein. Residues in the C-terminal region of the U2AF<sup>65</sup> inter-RRM linker comprise a centrally located binding site for the fifth nucleotide on the RRM2 surface and abutting the RRM1/RRM2 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). The backbone amide of the linker V254 and the carbonyl of T252 engage in hydrogen bonds with the rU5-O4 and -N3H atoms. In the C-terminal &#x003b2;-strand of RRM1, the side chains of K225 and R227 donate additional hydrogen bonds to the rU5-O2 lone pair electrons. The C-terminal region of the inter-RRM linker also participates in the preceding rU4-binding site, where the V254 backbone carbonyl and D256 carboxylate position the K260 side chain to hydrogen bond with the rU4-O4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Otherwise, the rU4 nucleotide packs against F304 in the signature ribonucleoprotein consensus motif (RNP)-2 of RRM2.</p><p>At the opposite side of the central fifth nucleotide, the sixth rU6 nucleotide is located at the inter-RRM1/RRM2 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>). This nucleotide twists to face away from the U2AF<sup>65</sup> linker and instead inserts the rU6-uracil into a sandwich between the &#x003b2;2/&#x003b2;3 loops of RRM1 and RRM2. The rU6 base edge is relatively solvent exposed; accordingly, the rU6 hydrogen bonds with U2AF<sup>65</sup> are water mediated apart from a single direct interaction by the RRM1-N196 side chain.</p><p>We tested the contribution of the U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L interactions with the new central nucleotide to Py-tract affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3i</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a,b</xref>). Mutagenesis of either V254 in the U2AF<sup>65</sup> inter-RRM linker to proline or RRM1&#x02013;R227 to alanine, which remove the hydrogen bond with the fifth uracil-O4 or -O2, reduced the affinities of U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L for the representative AdML Py tract by four- or five-fold, respectively. The energetic penalties due to these mutations (&#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>G</italic> 0.8&#x02013;0.9&#x02009;kcal&#x02009;mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) are consistent with the loss of each hydrogen bond with the rU5 base and support the relevance of the central nucleotide interactions observed in the U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L structures.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>U2AF<sup>65</sup> RRM extensions interact with the Py tract</title><p>The N- and C-terminal extensions of the U2AF<sup>65</sup> RRM1 and RRM2 directly contact the bound Py tract. Rather than interacting with a new 5&#x02032;-terminal nucleotide as we had hypothesized, the C-terminal &#x003b1;-helix of RRM2 instead folds across one surface of rU3 in the third binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). There, a salt bridge between the K340 side chain and nucleotide phosphate, as well as G338-base stacking and a hydrogen bond between the backbone amide of G338 and the rU3-O4, secure the RRM2 extension. Indirectly, the additional contacts with the third nucleotide shift the rU2 nucleotide in the second binding site closer to the C-terminal &#x003b2;-strand of RRM2. Consequently, the U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L-bound rU2-O4 and -N3H form dual hydrogen bonds with the K329 backbone atoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), rather than a single hydrogen bond with the K329 side chain as in the prior dU2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2 structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p>At the N terminus, the &#x003b1;-helical extension of U2AF<sup>65</sup> RRM1 positions the Q147 side chain to bridge the eighth and ninth nucleotides at the 3&#x02032; terminus of the Py tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f&#x02013;h</xref>). The Q147 residue participates in hydrogen bonds with the -N3H of the eighth uracil and -O2 of the ninth pyrimidine. The adjacent R146 guanidinium group donates hydrogen bonds to the 3&#x02032;-terminal ribose-O2&#x02032; and O3&#x02032; atoms, where it could form a salt bridge with a phospho-diester group in the context of a longer pre-mRNA.

Altogether, the U2AF<sup>65</sup> inter-RRM linker residues (R228&#x02013;K260) bury 2,800&#x02009;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> of surface area in the U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L holo-protein, suggestive of a cognate interface compared with 1,900&#x02009;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> for a typical protein&#x02013;protein complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The path of the linker initiates at P229 following the core RRM1 &#x003b2;-strand, in a kink that is positioned by intra-molecular stacking among the consecutive R228, Y232 and P234 side chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, lower right). A second kink at P236, coupled with respective packing of the L235 and M238 side chains on the N-terminal &#x003b1;-helical RRM1 extension and the core RRM1 &#x003b1;2-helix, reverses the direction of the inter-RRM linker towards the RRM1/RRM2 interface and away from the RNA-binding site. In the neighbouring apical region of the linker, the V244 and V246 side chains pack in a hydrophobic pocket between two &#x003b1;-helices of the core RRM1. The adjacent V249 and V250 are notable for their respective interactions that connect RRM1 and RRM2 at this distal interface from the RNA-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, top). A third kink stacks P247 and G248 with Y245 and re-orients the C-terminal region of the linker towards the RRM2 and bound RNA. At the RNA surface, the key V254 that recognizes the fifth uracil is secured via hydrophobic contacts between its side chain and the &#x003b2;-sheet surface of RRM2, chiefly the consensus RNP1-F304 residue that stacks with the fourth uracil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, lower left). Few direct contacts are made between the remaining residues of the linker and the U2AF<sup>65</sup> RRM2; instead, the C-terminal conformation of the linker appears primarily RNA mediated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>).</p><p>We investigated whether the observed contacts between the RRMs and linker were critical for RNA binding by structure-guided mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). We titrated these mutant U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L proteins into fluorescein-labelled AdML Py-tract RNA and fit the fluorescence anisotropy changes to obtain the apparent equilibrium affinities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4d&#x02013;h</xref>). We introduced glycine substitutions to maximally reduce the buried surface area without directly interfering with its hydrogen bonds between backbone atoms and the base. First, we replaced V249 and V250 at the RRM1/RRM2 interface and V254 at the bound RNA site with glycine (3Gly). However, the resulting decrease in the AdML RNA affinity of the U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L-3Gly mutant relative to wild-type protein was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). In parallel, we replaced five linker residues (S251, T252, V253, V254 and P255) at the fifth nucleotide-binding site with glycines (5Gly) and also found that the RNA affinity of the U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L-5Gly mutant likewise decreased only slightly relative to wild-type protein. A more conservative substitution of these five residues (251&#x02013;255) with an unrelated sequence capable of backbone-mediated hydrogen bonds (STVVP&#x0003e;NLALA) confirmed the subtle impact of this versatile inter-RRM sequence on affinity for the AdML Py tract. Finally, to ensure that these selective mutations were sufficient to disrupt the linker/RRM contacts, we substituted glycine for the majority of buried hydrophobic residues in the inter-RRM linker (including M144, L235, M238, V244, V246, V249, V250, S251, T252, V253, V254, P255; called 12Gly). Despite 12 concurrent mutations, the AdML RNA affinity of the U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L-12Gly variant was reduced by only three-fold relative to the unmodified protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>), which is less than the penalty of the V254P mutation that disrupts the rU5 hydrogen bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,i</xref>).</p><p>To test the interplay of the U2AF<sup>65</sup> inter-RRM linker with its N- and C-terminal RRM extensions, we constructed an internal linker deletion of 20-residues within the extended RNA-binding domain (dU2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L). We found that the affinity of dU2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L for the AdML RNA was significantly reduced relative to U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L (four-fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4i</xref>).

The U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L structures suggest that an extended conformation of the truncated dU2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2 inter-RRM linker would suffice to connect the U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L RRM1 C terminus to the N terminus of RRM2 (24&#x02009;&#x000c5; distance between U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L R227-C&#x003b1;&#x02013;H259-C&#x003b1; atoms), which agrees with the greater RNA affinities of dU2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2 and U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2 dual RRMs compared with the individual U2AF<sup>65</sup> RRMs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. However, stretching of the truncated dU2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L linker to connect the RRM termini is expected to disrupt its nucleotide interactions. Likewise, deletion of the N-terminal RRM1 extension in the shortened constructs would remove packing interactions that position the linker in a kinked turn following P229 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), consistent with the lower RNA affinities of dU2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L, dU2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2 and U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2 compared with U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L.</p><p>To further test cooperation among the U2AF65 RRM extensions and inter-RRM linker for RNA recognition, we tested the impact of a triple Q147A/V254P/R227A mutation (U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L-3Mut) for RNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4d</xref>). Notably, the Q147A/V254P/R227A mutation reduced the RNA affinity of the U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L-3Mut protein by 30-fold more than would be expected based on simple addition of the &#x00394;&#x00394;G's for the single mutations. This difference indicates that the linearly distant regions of the U2AF<sup>65</sup> primary sequence, including Q147 in the N-terminal RRM1 extension and R227/V254 in the N-/C-terminal linker regions at the fifth nucleotide site, cooperatively recognize the Py tract. Altogether, we conclude that the conformation of the U2AF<sup>65</sup> inter-RRM linker is key for recognizing RNA and is positioned by the RRM extension but otherwise relatively independent of the side chain composition. The non-additive effects of the Q147A/V254P/R227A triple mutation, coupled with the context-dependent penalties of an internal U2AF<sup>65</sup> linker deletion, highlights the importance of the structural interplay among the U2AF<sup>65</sup> linker and the N- and C-terminal extensions flanking the core RRMs.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Importance of U2AF<sup>65</sup>&#x02013;RNA contacts for pre-mRNA splicing</title><p>We proceeded to test the importance of new U2AF<sup>65</sup>&#x02013;Py-tract interactions for splicing of a model pre-mRNA substrate in a human cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).

The double-labelled U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L<sup>FRET</sup>(Cy3/Cy5) protein was tethered to a slide via biotin-NTA/Ni<sup>&#x0002b;2</sup> resin. Virtually no fluorescent molecules were detected in the absence of biotin-NTA/Ni<sup>&#x0002b;2</sup>, which demonstrates the absence of detectable non-specific binding of U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L<sup>FRET</sup> to the slide. The FRET distribution histogram built from more than a thousand traces of U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L<sup>FRET</sup>(Cy3/Cy5) in the absence of ligand showed an extremely broad distribution centred at a FRET efficiency of &#x0223c;0.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). Approximately 40&#x00025; of the smFRET traces showed apparent transitions between multiple FRET values (for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Despite the large width of the FRET-distribution histogram, the majority (80&#x00025;) of traces that showed fluctuations sampled only two distinct FRET states (for example, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>).

We cannot exclude a possibility that tethering of U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L<sup>FRET</sup>(Cy3/Cy5) to the microscope slide introduces structural heterogeneity into the protein and, thus, contributes to the breadth of the FRET distribution histogram. However, the presence of repetitive fluctuations between particular FRET values supports the hypothesis that RNA-free U2AF<sup>65</sup> samples several distinct conformations.

Hidden Markov modelling analysis of smFRET traces suggests that RNA-bound U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L can sample at least two other conformations corresponding to &#x0223c;0.7&#x02013;0.8 and &#x0223c;0.3 FRET values in addition to the predominant conformation corresponding to the 0.45 FRET state. Although a compact conformation (or multiple conformations) of U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L corresponding to &#x0223c;0.7&#x02013;0.8 FRET values can bind RNA, on RNA binding, these compact conformations of U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L transition into a more stable structural state that corresponds to &#x0223c;0.45 FRET value and is likely similar to the side-by-side inter-RRM-arrangement of the U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L crystal structures.

Several observations indicate that the numerous intramolecular contacts, here revealed among the inter-RRM linker and RRM1, RRM2, and the N-terminal RRM1 extension, synergistically coordinate U2AF<sup>65</sup>&#x02013;Py-tract recognition. Truncation of U2AF<sup>65</sup> to the core RRM1&#x02013;RRM2 region reduces its RNA affinity by 100-fold. Likewise, deletion of 20 inter-RRM linker residues significantly reduces U2AF<sup>65</sup>&#x02013;RNA binding only when introduced in the context of the longer U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L construct comprising the RRM extensions, which in turn position the linker for RNA interactions. Notably, a triple mutation of three residues (V254P, Q147A and R227A) in the respective inter-RRM linker, N- and C-terminal extensions non-additively reduce RNA binding by 150-fold. Altogether, these data indicate that interactions among the U2AF<sup>65</sup> RRM1/RRM2, inter-RRM linker, N-and C-terminal extensions are mutually inter-dependent for cognate Py-tract recognition. The implications of this finding for U2AF<sup>65</sup> conservation and Py-tract recognition are detailed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Discussion</xref>.</p><p>Recently, high-throughput sequencing studies have shown that somatic mutations in pre-mRNA splicing factors occur in the majority of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>.

Fluorescence emission was split into Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence using a dual view imaging system DV2 (Photometrics) equipped with a 630&#x02009;nm dichroic mirror and recorded <italic>via</italic> an Andor iXon&#x0002b; EMCCD camera. Movies were recorded using the Single software (downloaded from Prof. Taekjip Ha's laboratory website at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, physics.illinois.edu/cplc/software), with the exposure time set at 100&#x02009;ms. We typically took up to five 5-minute-long movies while imaging different sections of the slide for each sample. Before each measurement, we checked for non-specific binding by adding doubly-labeled U2Fret to the slide in the absence of neutravidin and imaging the slide. Non-specific binding was virtually absent.</p><p>Collected data sets were processed with IDL and Matlab softwares, using scripts downloaded from a freely available source: physics.illinois.edu/cplc/software. Apparent FRET efficiencies (<italic>E</italic><sub>app</sub>) were calculated from the emission intensities of donor (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Cy3</italic></sub>) and acceptor (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Cy5</italic></sub>) as follows: <italic>E</italic><sub>app</sub>=<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Cy5</italic></sub>/(<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Cy5</italic></sub>&#x0002b;<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Cy3</italic></sub>). The FRET distribution histograms were built from traces that showed single-step photobleaching in both Cy3 and Cy5 signals using a Matlab script generously provided by Prof. Peter Cornish (University of Missouri, Columbia). Anti-correlated changes in donor and acceptor intensities with constant sum of intensities indicated the presence of an energy transfer in single molecules labelled with one donor and one acceptor dye. All histograms were smoothed with a five-point window and plotted using Origin software (Origin Lab Co). Idealization of FRET trajectories was done using the hidden Markov model algorithms via HaMMy software (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bio.physics.illinois.edu/HaMMy.asp">http://bio.physics.illinois.edu/HaMMy.asp</ext-link>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Transition density plots were generated from transitions detected in idealized FRET trajectories obtained by HaMMy fit of raw FRET traces via Matlab. Frequency of transitions from starting FRET efficiency value (<italic>x</italic>-axis) to ending FRET efficiency value (<italic>y</italic>-axis) was represented by a heat map. The range of FRET efficiencies from 0 to 1 was separated in 200 bins. The resulting heat map was normalized to the most populated bin in the plot; the lower- and upper-bound thresholds were set to 20&#x00025; and 100&#x00025; of the most populated bin, respectively.</p><p>The surface contour plots were generated as follows: the individual single-molecule FRET traces (for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6g</xref> of the main text and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7e,f</xref>) were post synchronized at the first time point showing non-zero (&#x0003e;0.15) FRET efficiency, corresponding to binding. The time range (<italic>x</italic>-axis, 0&#x02013;10&#x02009;s) was separated into 100 bins. The FRET efficiency range (<italic>y</italic>-axis, 0&#x02013;1 FRET) was separated into 100 bins. A heat map is used to represent the frequency of sampling of each FRET state over time; frequency in each bin was normalized to the most populated bin in the plot with lower- and upper-bound thresholds set at 10&#x00025; and 80&#x00025; of the most populated bin, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional information</title><p><bold>Accession codes:</bold> Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession codes <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="5EV1">5EV1</ext-link>, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="5EV2">5EV2</ext-link>, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="5EV3">5EV3</ext-link> and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="5EV4">5EV4</ext-link> for respective U2AF<sup>65</sup>1,2L-oligonucleotide structures (i)&#x02013;(iv).</p><p><bold>How to cite this article:</bold> Agrawal, A.

Alternatively, a conformation of U2AF<sup>65</sup> corresponding to &#x0223c;0.45 FRET value can directly bind to RNA; RNA binding stabilizes the &#x02018;open', side-by-side conformation and thus shifts the U2AF<sup>65</sup> population towards the &#x0223c;0.45 FRET value.
