The majority of catabolic BMCs (metabolosomes) compartmentalize a common core of enzymes to metabolize compounds via a toxic and/or volatile aldehyde intermediate. The core enzyme phosphotransacylase (PTAC) recycles Coenzyme A and generates an acyl phosphate that can serve as an energy source. The PTAC predominantly associated with metabolosomes (PduL) has no sequence homology to the PTAC ubiquitous among fermentative bacteria (Pta). Here, we report two high-resolution PduL crystal structures with bound substrates. The PduL fold is unrelated to that of Pta; it contains a dimetal active site involved in a catalytic mechanism distinct from that of the housekeeping PTAC. Accordingly, PduL and Pta exemplify functional, but not structural, convergent evolution. The PduL structure, in the context of the catalytic core, completes our understanding of the structural basis of cofactor recycling in the metabolosome lumen.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>This study describes the structure of a novel phosphotransacylase enzyme that facilitates the recycling of the essential cofactor acetyl-CoA within a bacterial organelle and discusses the properties of the enzyme's active site and how it is packaged into the organelle.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>In metabolism, molecules with &#x0201c;high-energy&#x0201d; bonds (e.g., ATP and Acetyl~CoA) are critical for both catabolic and anabolic processes. Accordingly, the retention of these bonds during biochemical transformations is incredibly important. The phosphotransacylase (Pta) enzyme catalyzes the conversion between acyl-CoA and acyl-phosphate. This reaction directly links an acyl-CoA with ATP generation via substrate-level phosphorylation, producing short-chain fatty acids (e.g., acetate), and also provides a path for short-chain fatty acids to enter central metabolism. Due to this key function, Pta is conserved across the bacterial kingdom. Recently, a new type of phosphotransacylase was described that shares no evolutionary relation to Pta. This enzyme, PduL, is exclusively associated with organelles called bacterial microcompartments, which are used to catabolize various compounds. Not only does PduL facilitate substrate level phosphorylation, but it also is critical for cofactor recycling within, and product efflux from, the organelle. We solved the structure of this convergent phosphotransacylase and show that it is completely structurally different from Pta, including its active site architecture. We also discuss features of the protein important to its packaging in the organelle.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/">http://www.niaid.nih.gov/</ext-link>) grant 1R01AI114975-01.

The shell is typically composed of three types of protein subunits, which form either hexagonal (BMC-H and BMC-T) or pentagonal (BMC-P) tiles that assemble into a polyhedral shell. The facets of the shell are composed primarily of hexamers that are typically perforated by pores lined with highly conserved, polar residues [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] that presumably function as the conduits for metabolites into and out of the shell [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent propanediol-utilizing (PDU) BMC was one of the first functionally characterized catabolic BMCs [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; subsequently, other types have been implicated in the degradation of ethanolamine, choline, fucose, rhamnose, and ethanol, all of which produce different aldehyde intermediates (<xref rid="pbio.1002399.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). More recently, bioinformatic studies have demonstrated the widespread distribution of BMCs among diverse bacterial phyla [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and grouped them into 23 different functional types [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The reactions carried out in the majority of catabolic BMCs (also known as metabolosomes) fit a generalized biochemical paradigm for the oxidation of aldehydes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002399.g001">Fig 1</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This involves a BMC-encapsulated signature enzyme that generates a toxic and/or volatile aldehyde that the BMC shell sequesters from the cytosol [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The aldehyde is subsequently converted into an acyl-CoA by aldehyde dehydrogenase, which uses NAD<sup>+</sup> and CoA as cofactors [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These two cofactors are relatively large, and their diffusion across the protein shell is thought to be restricted, necessitating their regeneration within the BMC lumen [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

The concerted functioning of a PTAC and an acetate kinase (Ack) is crucial for ATP generation in the fermentation of pyruvate to acetate (see <bold>Reactions 1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>). Both enzymes are, however, not restricted to fermentative organisms. They can also work in the reverse direction to activate acetate to the CoA-thioester.

More recently, a second type of PTAC without any sequence homology to Pta was identified [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This protein, PduL (Pfam domain PF06130), was shown to catalyze the conversion of propionyl-CoA to propionyl-phosphate and is associated with a BMC involved in propanediol utilization, the PDU BMC [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Both <italic>pduL</italic> and <italic>pta</italic> genes can be found in genetic loci of functionally distinct BMCs, although the PduL type is much more prevalent, being found in all but one type of metabolosome locus: EUT1 (<xref rid="pbio.1002399.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Furthermore, in the Integrated Microbial Genomes Database [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], 91% of genomes that encode PF06130 also encode genes for shell proteins. As a member of the core biochemical machinery of functionally diverse aldehyde-oxidizing metabolosomes, PduL must have a certain level of substrate plasticity (see <xref rid="pbio.1002399.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) that is not required of Pta, which has generally been observed to prefer acetyl-CoA [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. PduL from the PDU BMC of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> favors propionyl-CoA over acetyl-CoA [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and it is likely that PduL orthologs in functionally diverse BMCs would have substrate preferences for other CoA derivatives. Another distinctive feature of BMC-associated PduL homologs is an N-terminal encapsulation peptide (EP) that is thought to &#x0201c;target&#x0201d; proteins for encapsulation by the BMC shell [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

In contrast, the structure of PduL, the PTAC found in the vast majority of catabolic BMCs, has not been determined. This is a major gap in our understanding of metabolosome-encapsulated biochemistry and cofactor recycling. Structural information will be essential to working out how the core enzymes and their cofactors assemble and organize within the organelle lumen to enhance catalysis. Moreover, it will be useful for guiding efforts to engineer novel BMC cores for biotechnological applications [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>The primary structure of PduL homologs is subdivided into two PF06130 domains, each roughly 80 residues in length. No available protein structures contain the PF06130 domain, and homology searches using the primary structure of PduL do not return any significant results that would allow prediction of the structure. Moreover, the evident novelty of PduL makes its structure interesting in the context of convergent evolution of PTAC function; to-date, only the Pta active site and catalytic mechanism is known [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Here we report high-resolution crystal structures of a PduL-type PTAC in both CoA- and phosphate-bound forms, completing our understanding of the structural basis of catalysis by the metabolosome common core enzymes.

We tested this hypothesis by performing size exclusion chromatography on both full-length and truncated variants (lacking the EP, &#x00394;EP) of sPduL, rPduL, and pPduL. These three homologs are found in functionally distinct BMCs (<xref rid="pbio.1002399.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

In contrast, both full-length rPduL and pPduL appeared to exist in two distinct oligomeric states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002399.g005">Fig 5b and 5c</xref> respectively, orange curves), one form of the approximate size of a dimer and the second, a higher molecular weight oligomer (~150 kDa). Upon deletion of the putative EP (residues 1&#x02013;47 for rPduL, and 1&#x02013;20 for pPduL), there was a distinct change in the elution profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002399.g005">Fig 5b and 5c</xref> respectively, blue curves). pPduL&#x00394;EP eluted as two smaller forms, possibly corresponding to a trimer and a monomer. In contrast, rPduL&#x00394;EP eluted as one smaller oligomer, possibly a dimer. We also analyzed purified rPduL and rPduL&#x00394;EP by size exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) for a complementary approach to assessing oligomeric state. SEC-MALS analysis of rPdul&#x00394;EP is consistent with a dimer (as observed in the crystal structure) with a weighted average (M<sub>w</sub>) and number average (M<sub>n</sub>) of the molar mass of 58.4 kDa +/&#x02212; 11.2% and 58.8 kDa +/&#x02212; 10.9%, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002399.s006">S4a Fig</xref>). rPduL full length runs as M<sub>w</sub> = 140.3 kDa +/&#x02212; 1.2% and M<sub>n</sub> = 140.5 kDa +/&#x02212; 1.2%. This corresponds to an oligomeric state of six subunits (calculated molecular weight of 144 kDa). Collectively, these data strongly suggest that the N-terminal EP of PduL plays a role in defining the quaternary structure of the protein.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec006"><title>Discussion</title><p>The hallmark attribute of an organelle is that it serves as a discrete subcellular compartment functioning as an isolated microenvironment distinct from the cytosol. In order to create and preserve this microenvironment, the defining barrier (i.e., lipid bilayer membrane or microcompartment shell) must be selectively permeable. The BMC shell not only sequesters specific enzymes but also their cofactors, thereby establishing a private cofactor pool dedicated to the encapsulated reactions. In catabolic BMCs, CoA and NAD<sup>+</sup> must be continually recycled within the organelle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002399.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Homologs of the predominant cofactor utilizer (aldehyde dehydrogenase) and NAD<sup>+</sup> regenerator (alcohol dehydrogenase) have been structurally characterized, but until now structural information was lacking for PduL, which recycles CoA in the organelle lumen [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

However, the amino acid sequences of the two domains are only 16% identical (mainly the RHxH motif, &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;10), and 34% similar. Our structure reveals that the two assigned PF06130 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002399.g003">Fig 3</xref>) do not form structurally discrete units; this reduces the apparent sequence conservation at the level of primary structure. One strand of the domain 1 beta barrel (shown in blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002399.g002">Fig 2</xref>) is contributed by the N-terminus, while the rest of the domain is formed by the residues from the C-terminal half of the protein. When aligned by structure, the &#x003b2;1 strand of the first domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002399.g002">Fig 2a and 2b</xref>, blue) corresponds to the final strand of the second domain (&#x003b2;9), effectively making the domains continuous if the first strand was transplanted to the C-terminus. Refined domain assignment based on our structure should be able to predict domains of PF06130 homologs much more accurately. The closest structural homolog of the PduL barrel domain is a subdomain of a multienzyme complex, the alpha subunit of ethylbenzene dehydrogenase [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002399.s007">S5b Fig</xref>, rmsd of 2.26 &#x000c5; over 226 aligned atoms consisting of one beta barrel and one capping helix). In contrast to PduL, there is only one barrel present in ethylbenzene dehydrogenase, and there is no comparable active site arrangement. The PduL signature primary structure, two PF06130 domains, occurs in some multidomain proteins, most of them annotated as Acks, suggesting that PduL may also replace Pta in variants of the phosphotransacetylase-Ack pathway. These PduL homologs lack EPs, and their fusion to Ack may have evolved as a way to facilitate substrate channeling between the two enzymes.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Implications for Metabolosome Core Assembly</title><p>For BMC-encapsulated proteins to properly function together, they must be targeted to the lumen and assemble into an organization that facilitates substrate/product channeling among the different catalytic sites of the signature and core enzymes. The N-terminal extension on PduL homologs may serve both of these functions. The extension shares many features with previously characterized EPs [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]: it is present only in homologs associated with BMC loci, and it is predicted to form an amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix. Moreover, its removal affects the oligomeric state of the protein. EP-mediated oligomerization has been observed for the signature and core BMC enzymes; for example, full-length propanediol dehydratase and ethanolamine ammonia-lyase (signature enzymes for PDU and EUT BMCs) subunits are also insoluble, but become soluble upon removal of the predicted EP [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. sPduL has also previously been reported to localize to inclusion bodies when overexpressed [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; we show here that this is dependent on the presence of the EP. This propensity of the EP to cause proteins to form complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002399.g005">Fig 5</xref>) might not be a coincidence, but could be a necessary step in the assembly of BMCs. Structured aggregation of the core enzymes has been proposed to be the initial step in metabolosome assembly [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and is known to be the first step of &#x003b2;-carboxysome biogenesis, where the core enzyme Ribulose Bisphosphate Carboxylase/Oxygenase (RuBisCO) is aggregated by the CcmM protein [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

Coupled with protein&#x02013;protein interactions with other luminal components, the aggregation of these enzymes could lead to a densely packed organelle core.

Free CoA and NAD<sup>+</sup>/H could potentially be bound to the enzymes as the core assembles and is encapsulated. However, this raises an issue of stoichiometry: if the ratio of cofactors to core enzymes is too low, then the sequestered metabolism would proceed at suboptimal rates. Our PduL crystals contained CoA that was captured from the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cytosol, indicating that the &#x0201c;ground state&#x0201d; of PduL is in the CoA-bound form; this could provide an elegantly simple means of guaranteeing a 1:1 ratio of CoA:PduL within the metabolosome lumen.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Active Site Identification and Structural Insights into Catalysis</title><p>The active site of PduL is formed at the interface of the two structural domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002399.g002">Fig 2b</xref>). As expected, the amino acid sequence conservation is highest in the region around the proposed active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002399.g004">Fig 4d</xref>); highly conserved residues are also involved in CoA binding (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002399.g002">2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002399.g003">3</xref>, residues Ser45, Lys70, Arg97, Leu99, His204, Asn211). All of the metal-coordinating residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002399.g002">Fig 2a</xref>) are absolutely conserved, implicating them in catalysis or the correct spatial orientation of the substrates. Arg103, which contacts the phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002399.g004">Fig 4b</xref>), is present in all PduL homologs. The close resemblance between the structures binding CoA and phosphate likely indicates that no large changes in protein conformation are involved in catalysis, and that our crystal structures are representative of the active form. The native substrate for the forward reaction of rPduL and pPduL, propionyl-CoA, most likely binds to the enzyme in the same way at the observed nucleotide and pantothenic acid moiety, but the propionyl group in the CoA-thioester might point in a different direction. There is a pocket nearby the active site between the well-conserved residues Ser45 and Ala154, which could accommodate the propionyl group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002399.s008">S6 Fig</xref>). A homology model of sPduL indicates that the residues making up this pocket and the surrounding active site region are identical to that of rPduL, which is not surprising, because these two homologs presumably have the same propionyl-CoA substrate. The homology model of pPduL also has identical residues making up the pocket, but with a key difference in the vicinity of the active site: Gln77 of rPduL is replaced by a tyrosine (Tyr77) in pPduL. The physiological substrate of pPduL (<xref rid="pbio.1002399.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) is thought to be lactyl-CoA, which contains an additional hydroxyl group relative to propionyl-CoA. The presence of an aromatic residue at this position may underlie the substrate preference of the PduL enzyme from the <italic>pvm</italic> locus. Indeed, in the majority of PduLs encoded in <italic>pvm</italic> loci, Gln77 is substituted by either a Tyr or Phe, whereas it is typically a Gln or Glu in PduLs in all other BMC types that degrade acetyl- or propionyl-CoA. A comparison of the PduL active site to that of the functionally identical Pta suggests that the two enzymes have distinctly different mechanisms. The catalytic mechanism of Pta involves the abstraction of a thiol hydrogen by an aspartate residue, resulting in the nucleophilic attack of thiolate upon the carbonyl carbon of acetyl-phosphate, oriented by an arginine and stabilized by a serine [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]&#x02014;there are no metals involved. In contrast, in the rPduL structure, there are no conserved aspartate residues in or around the active site, and the only well-conserved glutamate residue in the active site is involved in coordinating one of the metal ions. These observations strongly suggest that an acidic residue is not directly involved in catalysis by PduL. Instead, the dimetal active site of PduL may create a nucleophile from one of the hydroxyl groups on free phosphate to attack the carbonyl carbon of the thioester bond of an acyl-CoA. In the reverse direction, the metal ion(s) could stabilize the thiolate anion that would attack the carbonyl carbon of an acyl-phosphate; a similar mechanism has been described for phosphatases where hydroxyl groups or hydroxide ions can act as a base when coordinated by a dimetal active site [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Our structures provide the foundation for studies to elucidate the details of the catalytic mechanism of PduL. Conserved residues in the active site that may contribute to substrate binding and/or transition state stabilization include Ser127, Arg103, Arg194, Gln107, Gln74, and Gln/Glu77. In the phosphate-bound crystal structure, Ser127 and Arg103 appear to position the phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002399.g004">Fig 4b</xref>). Alternatively, Arg103 might act as a base to render the phosphate more nucleophilic. The functional groups of Gln74, Gln/Glu77, and Arg194 are directed away from the active site in both CoA and phosphate-bound crystal structures and do not appear to be involved in hydrogen bonding with these substrates, although they could be important for positioning an acyl-phosphate.</p><p>The free CoA-bound form is presumably poised for attack upon an acyl-phosphate, indicating that the enzyme initially binds CoA as opposed to acyl-phosphate. This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that the CoA-bound crystals were obtained without added CoA, indicating that the protein bound CoA from the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> expression strain and retained it throughout purification and crystallization. The phosphate-bound structure indicates that in the opposite reaction direction phosphate is bound first, and then an acyl-CoA enters.

There are several examples of such functional convergence of enzymes, although typically the enzymes have independently evolved similar, or even identical active sites; for example, the carbonic anhydrase family [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, apparently less frequent is functional convergence that is supported by distinctly different active sites and accordingly catalytic mechanism, as revealed by comparison of the structures of Pta and PduL. One well-studied example of this is the &#x003b2;-lactamase family of enzymes, in which the active site of Class A and Class C enzymes involve serine-based catalysis, but Class B enzymes are metalloproteins [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This is not surprising, as &#x003b2;-lactamases are not so widespread among bacteria and therefore would be expected to have evolved independently several times as a defense mechanism against &#x003b2;-lactam antibiotics. However, nearly all bacteria encode Pta, and it is not immediately clear why the Pta/PduL functional convergence should have evolved: it would seem to be evolutionarily more resourceful for the Pta-encoding gene to be duplicated and repurposed for BMCs, as is apparently the case in one type of BMC&#x02014;EUT1 (<xref rid="pbio.1002399.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). There could be some intrinsic biochemical difference between the two enzymes that renders PduL a more attractive candidate for encapsulation in a BMC&#x02014;for example, PduL might be more amenable to tight packaging, or is better suited for the chemical microenvironment formed within the lumen of the BMC, which can be quite different from the cytosol [<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002399.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].

We have observed the oligomeric state differences of PduL to correlate with the presence of an EP, providing new insight into the function of this sequence extension in BMC assembly. Moreover, our results suggest a means for Coenzyme A incorporation during metabolosome biogenesis. A detailed understanding of the underlying principles governing the assembly and internal structural organization of BMCs is a requisite for synthetic biologists to design custom nanoreactors that use BMC architectures as a template.
